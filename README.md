This simple python program is highly optimized. It counts the maximum occuring character in a string. It checks if the character is an alphabet or not.
It then sets checks if the character exists in the dictionary and then keeps  on incrementing by one until the max count of the char is found.
it implements a simple algorithm. But it's mostly about optimizing and writing this with less lines of code.
